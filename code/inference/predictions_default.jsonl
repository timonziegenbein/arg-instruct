Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion).

(a term that has unchanged in 5000 years, even today- \"sodomy\") apart from the fact the city was clearly destroyed by god because of homosexuality in the narrative of gen 19, even the new testament clearly states exactly the same thing in jude 7 \"just as sodom and gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example, in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.\" any sinner should always remember that the god who commands us to love our neighbour is the same god who will cast any and all unrepentant sinners into the \"eternal fire\". here are more bible quotes, lev 18:22-23 \"you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" lev 20:13 \"if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death.\" 1 cor 6:9 \"or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god? do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals\" 1 tim 1:9-10 \"realizing the fact that (civil) law is not made for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers\" rom 1:26-27 \"for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\" if the homosexual community chooses to practice homosexuality in privacy, that is there free choice. but let such persons know for certain that the christian bible condemns all such practices and god will judge them unfit for the kingdom of heaven if the continue to practice and openly promote homosexual sex. seven things i wish pro-gay people would admit by bob davies 1. i wish they would admit that many people are not happy with their homosexuality or lesbianism, and that this conflict is internal, based on legitimate, intelligent religious and moral convictions--not just the result of a so-called \"homophobic\" society which is forcing guilt upon people who don't conform to a heterosexual ethic. stop throwing out the cheap, inaccurate labels like \"internalized homophobia\" to explain our motivations. 2. i wish they would acknowledge that homosexuals and lesbians can experience significant change in their sexual feelings and desires, even though they may never be totally heterosexual in their sexual thoughts and feelings. be honest enough to admit that such change is significant and genuine, even if it isn't complete. 3. i wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have found a greater measure of peace and satisfaction after leaving a gay or lesbian lifestyle than they ever experienced while embracing homosexuality. not all \"ex-gays\" are miserable, plotting how to secretly fulfill their homosexual lusts without being caught. 4. i wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have genuine joy in their marriages. most former gays and lesbians don't get married in a futile attempt to \"escape\" homosexuality; they marry as a natural consequence of resolving that issue in their lives. 5. i wish they would acknowledge that all people have as much right to pursue a heterosexual lifestyle as they do to pursue homosexuality. former homosexuals and lesbians should not be harassed and castigated by the gay community. but i have never heard any gay or lesbian leaders speak out against the violence (such as bomb threats and physical/verbal abuse) which some people perpetuate against exodus ministries. 6. i wish they would stop equating our decision to leave homosexuality with \"hatred\" and \"bigotry\" against gays and lesbians. we don't hate gays; we simply desire to live free of homosexuality. don't put nasty labels upon our motives. that's being judgmental and unfair. 7. i wish pro-gay religious leaders would admit that their endorsement and promotion of monogamous homosexual relationships is a facade. many--probably most--men and women involved in long-term partnerships are not sexually monogamous, but gay churches don't discipline members for committing \"adultery\" outside their \"gay marriage.\" neither do they discipline gays or lesbians who have sex before entering into a \"holy union\" with their partner.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Not the same side.", "reference": "Not the same side"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: gaychristian.com is a biased source which will obviously take brother love like you described earlier into a gay love! my sources are directly from verses of the bible not the part that you take out of context if you read the bible there are plenty of examples especially in leviticus that say homosexuality is wrong. http://www.bible.ca... the bible's condemnation of homosexuality is as clear and plain as the bible's condemnation of murder, adultery, premarital sex, kidnapping, lying and idolatry. further, for me to openly condemn homosexuality theologically makes me no more a \"gay basher\" than i am an \"adultery basher\", \"premarital sex basher\", \"kidnapper basher\" or a \"murderer basher\". if you disagree, your argument is with god's bible. the homosexual community has two ways of promoting their personal choices of being homosexual through the religious forum. first, some will claim the bible actually promotes and condones homosexuality. second, others try to get the bible banned from public use by categorizing it as hate literature. for any to use the bible to condone rather than condemn homosexual activity in the theological arena just proves such a one has absolutely no idea what the bible actually teaches. for anyone to suggest the bible says homosexual activity is acceptable to god, is nothing short of willful blindness. so to set the record straight once and for all, here is what the bible teaches on the subject. anyone who has heard of the cities of \"sodom and gommorah\" knows that they were notorious hotbeds of homosexuality. gen 19:5-8 \"and they called to lot and said to him, 'where are the men who came to you tonight? bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.' but lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, and said, 'please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.'\" the greek word in the new testament for homosexuality is literally \"a sodomite\". jock is trying to redefine what the term \"sodomite\" means. (a term that has unchanged in 5000 years, even today- \"sodomy\") apart from the fact the city was clearly destroyed by god because of homosexuality in the narrative of gen 19, even the new testament clearly states exactly the same thing in jude 7 \"just as sodom and gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example, in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.\" any sinner should always remember that the god who commands us to love our neighbour is the same god who will cast any and all unrepentant sinners into the \"eternal fire\". here are more bible quotes, lev 18:22-23 \"you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" lev 20:13 \"if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death.\" 1 cor 6:9 \"or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god? do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals\" 1 tim 1:9-10 \"realizing the fact that (civil) law is not made for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers\" rom 1:26-27 \"for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\" if the homosexual community chooses to practice homosexuality in privacy, that is there free choice. but let such persons know for certain that the christian bible condemns all such practices and god will judge them unfit for the kingdom of heaven if the continue to practice and openly promote homosexual sex. seven things i wish pro-gay people would admit by bob davies 1. i wish they would admit that many people are not happy with their homosexuality or lesbianism, and that this conflict is internal, based on legitimate, intelligent religious and moral convictions--not just the result of a so-called \"homophobic\" society which is forcing guilt upon people who don't conform to a heterosexual ethic. stop throwing out the cheap, inaccurate labels like \"internalized homophobia\" to explain our motivations. 2. i wish they would acknowledge that homosexuals and lesbians can experience significant change in their sexual feelings and desires, even though they may never be totally heterosexual in their sexual thoughts and feelings. be honest enough to admit that such change is significant and genuine, even if it isn't complete. 3. i wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have found a greater measure of peace and satisfaction after leaving a gay or lesbian lifestyle than they ever experienced while embracing homosexuality. not all \"ex-gays\" are miserable, plotting how to secretly fulfill their homosexual lusts without being caught. 4. i wish they would acknowledge that many former homosexuals and lesbians have genuine joy in their marriages. most former gays and lesbians don't get married in a futile attempt to \"escape\" homosexuality; they marry as a natural consequence of resolving that issue in their lives. 5. i wish they would acknowledge that all people have as much right to pursue a heterosexual lifestyle as they do to pursue homosexuality. former homosexuals and lesbians should not be harassed and castigated by the gay community. but i have never heard any gay or lesbian leaders speak out against the violence (such as bomb threats and physical/verbal abuse) which some people perpetuate against exodus ministries. 6. i wish they would stop equating our decision to leave homosexuality with \"hatred\" and \"bigotry\" against gays and lesbians. we don't hate gays; we simply desire to live free of homosexuality. don't put nasty labels upon our motives. that's being judgmental and unfair. 7. i wish pro-gay religious leaders would admit that their endorsement and promotion of monogamous homosexual relationships is a facade. many--probably most--men and women involved in long-term partnerships are not sexually monogamous, but gay churches don't discipline members for committing \"adultery\" outside their \"gay marriage.\" neither do they discipline gays or lesbians who have sex before entering into a \"holy union\" with their partner.\n\nArgument 2: i have backed up my position with proof and facts. i'm sure you are an awesomne person, but i disagree with you on gay rights. the antigay position is a religious idea that has no place dictating the law. go to gaychristian101.com and read all of the articles before you judge.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Argument 1 and Argument 2 are on the same side.", "reference": "Not the same side"}

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. \r\nVeal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. \r\nBaked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.\r\nFinal thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre.

Let the churches perform marriages for whomever they think fit, and let the government simply record the marraiges or civil unions and grant equal rights to them all.  As for plural \"marriages,\"  they exist, but there is not a sizable part of the population which supports them.  That is a different debate for another day, and the issues are quite different.  In my mind, the purpose of marriage or civil union is to provide support to individuals, especially when they are raising children.  Some of the most monogamous couples I know are gay, and they are some of the best parents too.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Does Not Have Unclear Meaning.", "reference": "Has Unclear Meaning"}

I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Appropriate.

To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option.

If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Confusing Reasoning. The argument does not present any logical connection between the premises and the conclusion. It starts by asserting that those who do not want gay marriage to be allowed just don't like homosexuality, implying that this is a prejudiced position. Then it goes on to say that if two men or two women are happy together, love each other and want to be with each other forever, seemingly implying that this is a reason why they should be allowed to get married.

The full legal text says, \"You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\"\r\n\r\nDetermining what is \"primarily intended\" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license.

With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing to rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill.

Budweiser is for retards who don't know what beer is. \r\n\r\nBut Yuengling is mass produced and... actually pretty good. \r\n\r\nIt's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything. \r\n\r\nCraft brews are getting a lot of attention in recent years, especially in America, and a lot of beer snobs go to parties. \r\n\r\nThese guys are not easy to please, but they *will* settle for Yuengling.

With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing to rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Does Not Lack Commitment. The argument presented is well-structured and provides clear evidence to support the claim that the race car is a better vehicle than the dirt bike for 90% of maps on hill climb racing.

When the fingerstache meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism. Each moustache that sprouts from the faces of my beloved citizens is, in fact, a black, hairy, evil flag.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Confusing Reasoning.", "reference": "Has Confusing Reasoning"}

With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing to rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill.

Since alcohol prohibition ended and the War on Drugs began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,[70] and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most \"\"dangerous\"\" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol).\nConclusion A: Ending drug prohibition would reduce use.\nConclusion B: Ending drug use would reduce use\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Conclusion A is more valid than Conclusion B in terms of validity. This is because Conclusion A suggests that ending drug prohibition would reduce the use of hard drugs, whereas Conclusion B suggests that ending drug use would reduce the use of hard drugs. The former implies that reducing the legal status of drugs would lead to less usage, while the latter implies that reducing the usage of drugs would lead to less usage.

I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up.

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. \r\nVeal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. \r\nBaked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.\r\nFinal thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Lacks Intelligibility", "reference": "Does Not Lack Intelligibility"}

To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option.

When the fingerstache meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism.

and in that case what would even be the difference between a civil union and a marriage? in that case it would only be a difference of nomenclature. and you say barren women and men can get married, but there is a potential for conception. but there is no potential for conception between a man and a barren woman.so all in all, i would like to see you respond to my first paragraph, and please keep your arguments consistent.\n\nArgument 2: gay marriage should be legal in all 50 states, protected by a federal law. we should recognize that the natural world creates natural distinctions between male and female, and their cohabitation etc is what produces offspring. they are a natural unit for the purposes of kids, and a natural unit for the purposes of simply recognizing nature. we can have civil unions or something to respect others, perhaps, but that doesn't mean we have to give the same value to something that is fundamentally different, by calling it marriage. also, as far as procreation goes... we're simply recognizing that procreation would ever only occur with a male and a female... even if they are infertile, we're recognizing the inherent value that only a male and a female can procreate. we could look atgranting marriage to an infertile couple as simply a nice gesture that recnogizes their born potential, even if it's no longer effectively there. as a note, it is not clear if pro thinks there should be a federal statute or constitutional amendment that allows gay marriage. the debate just says \"federal law\". he does mention the 14th amendment so i will address that. the main point is that this is something the legislature should decide, not a bunch of unelected officials. when u give rights to gay marriage, you deprive religious rights to fashion laws as you see fit, and that amendment for religion is explicit and primary in the first amendment. there's something moral about letting localities decide their own laws, even if you disagree with them. when the 14th amendment was ratified, it was because of black rights. so it is reasonable that we allow interracial marriage. when that amendment was passed, no one permitted gay marriage. we should look to the origional context to decide if this is an issue that is fundamental, or not. given only a third of people even agreed with gay marriage even ten years ago, shows that this isn't something fundamental, but an \"extra\" that can be debated. only now does majority rule favor gay marraige, but taht doesn't mean localities should be denied their right to decide for themselves. afterall, the tenth amendment gives power to the states to decide anything not listed explicitly in the constitution. and a final note. they got the right as it was deemed \"fundamental\". this is something like hte right to raise your kids, that is basic to human dignity. marriage is a man made institution and isn't fundamental to anyone's existence. should we look at gay marriage as so similar to other fundametal rights like raising your kids? it's not on the same level\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Argument 1 and Argument 2 are on the same side.", "reference": "Not the same side"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: the united methodist church should recognize gay marriage hello kylar. i appreciate your question, and i gladly accept. i hope you enjoy having this debate. lets begin. my argument will be rather simple in its approach: 1) the untied methodist church upholds the doctrine of the classical scriptural cannon according to damasine council of rome and third council of carthage. 2) scripture clearly teaches that marriage is between a man and a women, and any other sexual relationship should not be allowed in the church. 3) therefore, a gay \"marriage\" should not be recognized in the church, and the members of the united methodist church should not be in such a union. point 1 on the united methodist webpage they say \"we believe that the bible is god\"s word and is the primary authority for our faith and practice.\" so clearly methodist theology will bend around the words of scripture. (* http://www.umc.org... ) point 2 now please note when i am arguing i am specifically arguing from the point of view of scripture. also i am not arguing that people who are not members of the christian faith have to uphold these commands, because paul is rather clear that unbelievers in christ should be expected to act exactly like people who do not have god. however paul when writing to the believers in corinth said \"9 or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god? do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god. 11 and that is what some of you were. but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god.\" -1 corinthians 6: 9-11 so, clearly homosexuality is condemned that this sexual behavior is condemned, but also jesus has a very specific idea of marriage. jesus said: \" 4 \"haven\"t you read,\" he replied, \"that at the beginning the creator \"made them male and female, 5 and said, \"for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh? 6 so they are no longer two, but one flesh. therefore what god has joined together, let no one separate.\" matthew 19 4-6 jesus sees the union of a man and a women as the sacred bond which follows the old testament tradition. and any other sexual interaction, including gay marriage is considered a sin. point 3- now, since the united methodist church wants to uphold their scriptural beliefs, they do not want to allow a person fully celebrating a sinful life (according to scripture) to be a part of their church body, and will not support and say it is completely natural and fine. i will continue on with the implications and the legality in the rebuttal along with any significant claims made by my friend kylar.\n\nArgument 2: the united methodist church should recognize gay marriage i would like to begin by apologizing to my friend kylar for failing to post a response for round 2. i had some confusion in timing, but i still would like to say i deeply apologize. first off i am generally confused: it seems i have misread the original prompt and thus forfeit this debate by the fact i cannot think of any legal or religious reason against mr. kylar's position. i am extremely sorry for misunderstanding you and would like to kindly ask you attempt this debate again with someone against your position. sincerely, tanner jones\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Same side.", "reference": "Same side"}

Indeed, it may be appropriate to connect the notion of \"dominion\" to stewardship\" over animals. Yet, humans can be good stewards of animals while continuing to eat them. It is merely necessary that humans maintain balance, order, and sustainability in the animal kingdom.

It acknowledges that humans can be good stewards of animals while still eating meat, which is a more sensible and compassionate view.

Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs, as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs. Most drug crimes aren\u2019t committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they\u2019re committed by people on drugs.\u2014 US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003). \"Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization\" DUF research indicates that: Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career. Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime. Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood. Those arrested who are drug users are more likely than those not using drugs to be rearrested on pretrial release or fail to appear at trial.\nConclusion A: Drug-use and crime go hand-in-hand\nConclusion B: Drug-related crimes go hand in hand\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Conclusion A is better than conclusion B in terms of validity.", "reference": "Yes"}

Ask any country that has employed it. You'll find that their crime rates are MUCH lower than the USA's. This only applies if the nation is comfortable with it of course. \r\nOn the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice.\r\n\r\nIts simply a matter of perspective in the end.The typical christian perspective goes against capital punishment and thats due to this christian country. \r\nThe simple truth is that its effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, its barbaric, immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Does Not Have Excessive Intensity.", "reference": "Has Excessive Intensity"}

Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.  But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.  How sane is it to allow someone who raped, tortured and killed a young girl to sit in a jail cell and live off taxpayer money?  If that individual feels someone INNOCENT deserves to die, why should they be allowed to live?  Again, I believe there should be WITHOUT a doubt concrete evidence against a person who is put on death row.\r\nAnd concerning abortion...unborn babies have not committed heinous crimes.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Excessive Intensity.", "reference": "Has Excessive Intensity"}

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. \r\nVeal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. \r\nBaked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing.

Since alcohol prohibition ended and the War on Drugs began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,[70] and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most \"\"dangerous\"\" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol).\nConclusion A: Ending drug use would reduce use\nConclusion B: Ending prohibition would reduce use of hard drugs\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Conclusion B is more valid than Conclusion A because it is based on actual evidence that ending prohibition would reduce use of hard drugs, while Conclusion A is based on speculation that ending drug use would reduce use.", "reference": "No"}

(Vice versa for gay men.)\r\nAdditionally, gay women are more \"socially acceptable,\" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.\r\nGay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is \"lowering himself\" to a women's level.\r\nGay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.\r\n(The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society)\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Excessive Intensity.", "reference": "Has Excessive Intensity"}

When the fingerstache meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism.

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. \r\nVeal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through.

This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. \r\nBaked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing.

This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. \r\nBaked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.\r\nFinal thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: ~counterarguments~ 1. marriage started by religion. - whether or not the origin of marriage was religious or not does not matter. in modern times of america, a secular nation adhering to a separation of church and state doctrine, religious reasons to keep marriage heterosexual is not valid. - marriage didn't originate in one place, but was developed in many societies during different times. monogamy wasn't the only type of marriage that was developed. i doubt my opponent is still an advocate of polygamy, endogamy, exogamy, proxy marriages, or arranged marriages. 2. science nature of marriage. - institutions have been created and developed by human beings as a mechanism for cooperation and social order. government is an example of a human institution, as is marriage and money, and even friendship. even though such abstract concepts do not exist amongst every other animal, this does not mean we should throw away such concepts. - to some we may not need marriage, and in fact some do believe that marriage is pointless. however, many people do want to get married, for reasons ranging from love to personal sentiment to economic, and it should be their right to be able to. 3. gay marriage already legalized. - while a very few number of states such as massachusetts is the only state that fully recognizes same-sex marriage, many other states of america still do not recognize it. note that i intend this debate to be based on american law, as is implied in my first round (sorry if i didn't make that clear). my side still stands as there are still a large number of states who are not in support of gay marriage. ~conclusion~ my opponent's points have been refuted accordingly. gay marriage should be legalized since there is no legal reason to make it illegal, and is almost seen with parallel with the prejudice against blacks and women not too long ago in history.\n\nArgument 2: ask almost anyone on the street and they will probably agree with you that homosexual's should have the same rights as heterosexuals. yet, once you get on the issue of marriage, more than half of the population in america is against it. this right to marriage is the last blockade for equal rights for homosexuals. i'll let my opponent go first.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Same side.", "reference": "Same side"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: i would like to thank my opponent for opening this debate. topic analysis: i think i can safely assume that, if i can prove gay marriage shouldn't be legalized, then i win the debate. debate: 1. i believe all homosexuals should have same rights as any other person. i don't, however, believe they should be allowed to marry. 2. gay people shouldn't be allowed marry because marriage was started by religion. most religions believe being gay is wrong. 3. science supports the fact. marriage is just something humans make up. they believe they can be one. obviously, religion is what created and supported this. as animals, we don't need marriage. 4. gay marriage is already legalized. several countries and states have already legalized gay marriage. including: canada, belgium, norway, spain, and states in the us. i argue this because it contradicts the debate starter's argument, therefore, proving he is already wrong. a.http://gaylife.about.com... conclusion: i have stated that marriage was not intended for gays by the creators of marriage(religion). i have shown that marriage is what humans create to satisfy ourselves only psychologically. i have also proved that my opponent is already in the wrong by stating gay marriage is already legalized, therefore, making this debate irrelevant. i shall await my opponent's response. thank you.\n\nArgument 2: final argument: 1. marriage started by religion keeping the meaning of the origin should be done throughout everything. it keeps history correct. making another meaning for something can be wrong doing. a. take george orwell's \"animal farm\" novel for example. the pigs change the original meaning of the laws of the farm to benefit themselves. this also shows the other animals behave more obediently and overlook the meaning of something. i. http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. origination of marriage like i said in my first response, it is important to keep the meaning and history of something. although, this is a different debate and my opponent should not stray from the subject. 3. marriages. it seems i misunderstood my opponent's 2nd round response. he said \"[he] doubts [i'm] still an advocate of polygamy, endogamy, exogamy, proxy marriages.\" i took the types of marriage as his examples of types that allow same-sex marriage which he didn't intend to mean. therefore, i will go back to what my opponent said before. an adovate is someone who speaks on behalf of something or someone. in this case, on behalf of the types of marriages. so rewording this sentence, my opponent originally meant,\"i doubt my opponent is still speaking on behalf of [the different types of marriages].\" on my first response, i never said i will speak on behalf if the types of marriages. also, since my opponent himself said,\"i intend this debate to be based on american law\", it is obvious we should be debating base on the american way of marriage: 2 people of whatever breed/race in a society or out of one and not pre-arranged. 4. never did i say we should abandon it. \"the concept should not be deserted.\"-pawletoe(round 3, response #4). 5. everything matters in a creations of anything. for example, a singer writes his latest album and intends to sing it at an army camp to support the troops. except, another singer steals the lyrics and sings it at an urban night club that ends up booing the singer off the stage. as a result, the original singer is accused of stealing music. this is one reason why any thing's origin is important. this is why we have created copyright laws. putting your own definitions to something is great, as long as you change the word of that which you have changed. 6. gay marriage is already legalized. i argued with this because i am showing how the united states has already approved of same-sex marriage. i will extend on my point. massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004. 3 years later, so does new jersey. now on 2008, california(on may 15th) and new york(on may 29th). new york passed the law 14 days after california. this shows more and more states are giving into gay people's demands. i wouldn't be surprised if 2 or 3 more states agreed to same-sex marriage this year... 7. future states my point is more and more states are allowing same-sex marriage. which in turn, makes this debate pointless. if in 3 years, 40% more states allow same-sex marriage, it would be point argue about this since same-sex marriage will be getting the majority of approval. a. for example: if i challenged you to a debate and argued, \"president lincoln was shot in the head\". that would be a pointless debate since it is self-evident through history. 8. majority against same-sex marriage. let me clarify... while states are allowing same-sex marriage, we as people are against it. no we shouldn't debate about this since it will be legalized. yes you do have an opinion. 9. bad side of gay marriage the resource states that same-sex marriage(registered partnership) has less benefits then heterosexual marriages(full marriage). it clearly states gay couples have less of a benefit. 10. the argument is an example why not to get married. it shows that gay marriage has a bad effect instead of a good one. having a different benefit from gays and straights is unequal which contradicts the constitution of the united states. 11. finally, people don't adapt to gay couples because it is so different to them. it can actually be blamed on the gays themselves. gay people always \"hide in the closet\" and never show themselves for who they are. this makes the public believe everyone else believe gay is wrong. how do you eventually get the point across to the public that gay people want to marry as well? 12. gays can easily be compared to african americans. after slaves gained freedom and same rights, we as americans are forced to call them by their origin race: african americans. this should done with gay marriage as well. we should not allow gay couples to disrespect the religion of others by marrying with a priest and walking around a fire 7 times or breaking glass, and all the other traditions religions have, etc. this is a huge insult to those who are religious. conclusion: my opponent has to originally argue why marriage should be legalized. as the contender, i not only have to disprove my opponent, but can also point out an unsuccessful argument, pointless debate, the change of the subject's origin. 1. i stated the origin of marriage must stay true to it's origin. if not the history and meaning is lost and it becomes something else not marriage. 2. i showed that the debate and argument is pointless since the majority of states will legalize marriage. 3. i disproved my opponent by saying if we legalize same-sex marriage, gay married couple will naturally be treated different then straight married couple. this will bring much chaos. 4. i have pointed out gay marriage is useless and is only made to please the need of gay couples. on the other hand: gay people should not use the religious ways of getting married and should \"be registered as partners for life\". gay non-married couples can enjoy the better rights and benefits then having under same-sex marriage. gay couples can easily wait and fight for acceptance which should be the first step. gay people should concentrate on gaining respect from the public first. they should not hide who they are. i have disproved my opponent, have provided several different resources, and have argument against all his responses.\n\n### Response:\n",

Six times as many homicides are committed by people under the influence of drugs, as by those who are looking for money to buy drugs. Most drug crimes aren\u2019t committed by people trying to pay for drugs; they\u2019re committed by people on drugs.\u2014 US Drug Enforcement Administration (2003). \"Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization\" DUF research indicates that: Frequent use of hard drugs is one of the strongest indicators of a criminal career. Offenders who use drugs are among the most serious and active criminals, engaging in both property and violent crime. Early and persistent use of cocaine or heroin in the juvenile years is an indicator of serious, persistent criminal behavior in adulthood.

Since alcohol prohibition ended and the War on Drugs began there has been much debate over the issue of consistency among legislators with regard to drug prohibition. Many anti-prohibition activists focus on the well-documented dangers of alcohol (such as alcoholism, cystisis, domestic violence, brain and liver damage). In addition to anecdotal evidence, they cite statistics to show more deaths caused by drunk driving under the influence of alcohol than by drivers under the influence of marijuana,[70] and research which suggests that alcohol is more harmful than all but the most \"\"dangerous\"\" drugs. When the level of harm associated with the other drugs includes harm that arises solely as a result of the drugs illegality rather than merely that danger which is associated with actually using the drugs, only heroin, cocaine, barbiturates and street methadone were shown to be more harmful than the legal drug alcohol).\nConclusion A: Ending drug use would reduce use\nConclusion B: Ending drug prohibition would reduce use.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Conclusion B is more valid than Conclusion A because it is based on the idea that ending drug prohibition would reduce the use of hard drugs, which is supported by evidence from countries such as The Netherlands.

Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option.

Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion).

Our judicial system needs to put policies in place that will prevent this from EVER happening.

[1] the current meaning of many things change over time, usually for the better. 2. origination of marriage. -as i have said before, the original meaning of marriage has no merit on its value now. 3. marriage. -i think it's fair to say to extend my point about the origin of marriage here. whatever the intended meaning of marriage may be does not matter; only the merit of its value now. my point about different forms of marriage is that they formed in different times with different reasoning, usually being religious in nature. thus it proves to be a point for you to solve; should you condone such marriages under a legal context because they are religious in origin? if you said no, which is most likely true to be, then it proves my point that gay marriage shouldn't be banned because it isn't supported by religion. 4. science and marriage. - untrue assertion on my opponent's part. he stated that because marriage is an invention of man (an institution), we should abandon it since it does not appear in nature amongst other animals. it doesn't matter who created, or why they created it, but what it means to us now and how we define it (in the context of this debate about the legality of gay marriage). - i also pointed out how many other institutions such as government aren't \"natural\". should we abandon them on the premise they are unnatural? it doesn't matter or not if the roots of government can be traced back to religion; just what it is now. 5. gay marriage already legalized. - my apology on the spelling error. however, my point still stands that there are yet states that haven't legalized it; and should legalize it as is the title of this topic. i fail to see your reasoning behind this point. 6. future states - those who still don't legalize same-sex marriage should; i fail to see your point. 7. majority against same-sex marriage. - i fail to see your point in this. so are you saying we should debate about it? after all, we have an opinion and so do others, and the one that comes out to be true affects people's lives. 8. bad side of gay marriage. - your source seems to work against you, the one you stated at least. it states: \"but, did you know most civil, domestic and registered partnership laws around the world provide fewer benefits than full marriage?\" so a careful reading shows that marriage has some benefits than other ways of partnership. so in fact, marriage wouldn't be a detriment to gay couples, but more of a benefit in a legal sense. - yet most people do not view marriage in such a light; not seeing as a legal opportunity to get some benefits; but for as you said psychological satisfaction. - this is not a point threatening my side, since what you brought up would be an issue for gay couples wanting to get married. this isn't an argument against the legality of gay marriage. ~conclusion~ my opponent's points have all been refuted, which several of them committing the genetic fallacy. gay marriage should be a right, since there hasn't surfaced yet a valid secular reasoning behind banning it. ---references---- 1. http://en.wikipedia.org...\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Same side.", "reference": "Same side"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: final argument: 1. marriage started by religion keeping the meaning of the origin should be done throughout everything. it keeps history correct. making another meaning for something can be wrong doing. a. take george orwell's \"animal farm\" novel for example. the pigs change the original meaning of the laws of the farm to benefit themselves. this also shows the other animals behave more obediently and overlook the meaning of something. i. http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. origination of marriage like i said in my first response, it is important to keep the meaning and history of something. although, this is a different debate and my opponent should not stray from the subject. 3. marriages. it seems i misunderstood my opponent's 2nd round response. he said \"[he] doubts [i'm] still an advocate of polygamy, endogamy, exogamy, proxy marriages.\" i took the types of marriage as his examples of types that allow same-sex marriage which he didn't intend to mean. therefore, i will go back to what my opponent said before. an adovate is someone who speaks on behalf of something or someone. in this case, on behalf of the types of marriages. so rewording this sentence, my opponent originally meant,\"i doubt my opponent is still speaking on behalf of [the different types of marriages].\" on my first response, i never said i will speak on behalf if the types of marriages. also, since my opponent himself said,\"i intend this debate to be based on american law\", it is obvious we should be debating base on the american way of marriage: 2 people of whatever breed/race in a society or out of one and not pre-arranged. 4. never did i say we should abandon it. \"the concept should not be deserted.\"-pawletoe(round 3, response #4). 5. everything matters in a creations of anything. for example, a singer writes his latest album and intends to sing it at an army camp to support the troops. except, another singer steals the lyrics and sings it at an urban night club that ends up booing the singer off the stage. as a result, the original singer is accused of stealing music. this is one reason why any thing's origin is important. this is why we have created copyright laws. putting your own definitions to something is great, as long as you change the word of that which you have changed. 6. gay marriage is already legalized. i argued with this because i am showing how the united states has already approved of same-sex marriage. i will extend on my point. massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004. 3 years later, so does new jersey. now on 2008, california(on may 15th) and new york(on may 29th). new york passed the law 14 days after california. this shows more and more states are giving into gay people's demands. i wouldn't be surprised if 2 or 3 more states agreed to same-sex marriage this year... 7. future states my point is more and more states are allowing same-sex marriage. which in turn, makes this debate pointless. if in 3 years, 40% more states allow same-sex marriage, it would be point argue about this since same-sex marriage will be getting the majority of approval. a. for example: if i challenged you to a debate and argued, \"president lincoln was shot in the head\". that would be a pointless debate since it is self-evident through history. 8. majority against same-sex marriage. let me clarify... while states are allowing same-sex marriage, we as people are against it. no we shouldn't debate about this since it will be legalized. yes you do have an opinion. 9. bad side of gay marriage the resource states that same-sex marriage(registered partnership) has less benefits then heterosexual marriages(full marriage). it clearly states gay couples have less of a benefit. 10. the argument is an example why not to get married. it shows that gay marriage has a bad effect instead of a good one. having a different benefit from gays and straights is unequal which contradicts the constitution of the united states. 11. finally, people don't adapt to gay couples because it is so different to them. it can actually be blamed on the gays themselves. gay people always \"hide in the closet\" and never show themselves for who they are. this makes the public believe everyone else believe gay is wrong. how do you eventually get the point across to the public that gay people want to marry as well? 12. gays can easily be compared to african americans. after slaves gained freedom and same rights, we as americans are forced to call them by their origin race: african americans. this should done with gay marriage as well. we should not allow gay couples to disrespect the religion of others by marrying with a priest and walking around a fire 7 times or breaking glass, and all the other traditions religions have, etc. this is a huge insult to those who are religious. conclusion: my opponent has to originally argue why marriage should be legalized. as the contender, i not only have to disprove my opponent, but can also point out an unsuccessful argument, pointless debate, the change of the subject's origin. 1. i stated the origin of marriage must stay true to it's origin. if not the history and meaning is lost and it becomes something else not marriage. 2. i showed that the debate and argument is pointless since the majority of states will legalize marriage. 3. i disproved my opponent by saying if we legalize same-sex marriage, gay married couple will naturally be treated different then straight married couple. this will bring much chaos. 4. i have pointed out gay marriage is useless and is only made to please the need of gay couples. on the other hand: gay people should not use the religious ways of getting married and should \"be registered as partners for life\". gay non-married couples can enjoy the better rights and benefits then having under same-sex marriage. gay couples can easily wait and fight for acceptance which should be the first step. gay people should concentrate on gaining respect from the public first. they should not hide who they are. i have disproved my opponent, have provided several different resources, and have argument against all his responses.\n\nArgument 2: 1. marriage start by religion. it does matter what is the origin of marriage is. if you do not follow what the creator of marriage intended, then it is not marriage. it is something that is similar but change and made up to fit your needs. you then would call it \"marriage version 21st century\" or something like that. 2. origination of marriage. notice that i never stated a place that marriage was originated. i said it was made by religion and social group's culture that do not accept same-sex marriage. 3. marriage. whether or not i know the different types of marriages does not matter in the debate. as the contender you are suppose to prove me wrong. here is a list of the types of marriages and how the originations don't accept same-sex marriage. a. polygamy is marriage of having more then 1 spouse. the several spouses are still the opposite sex. the several spouses aren't married to each other, only to the husband or wife. i. example: mormons, nomadic tibetans ii. http://en.wikipedia.org... b. endogamy is marriage within a social group. the social group leader does not approve of same-sex marriage. i. example: armenians in iran, jews, old order amish, jehovah's witness, etc. ii. http://en.wikipedia.org... c. exogamy is marriage of different breed. this isn't the marriage of same-sex. i. example: european marrying an african person. chinese marrying an american. ii. http://en.wikipedia.org... d. proxy marriage is, in other words, pre-arranged marriages. i strongly disapprove of this. this contradicts the constitution of the united states. a person should be able to marry who he/she wants. i. example: hindu ii. http://en.wikipedia.org... 4. science and marriage. the concept should not be deserted. agreed. my response is showing how marriage is not important even to heterosexual people as well. this might be attack straight couple marriage yet also gay marriage as well. 5. gay marriage already legalized. it seems my resource was overlooked by my opponent. massachusetts isn't \"the only state that fully recognizes same-sex marriage\". california, new jersey, new york, massachusetts, vermont, and connecticut allow same-sex marriage. 6. future states many future states have debates about same-sex marriage and if it should be allowed. already we see michigan, florida, and nevada as one of the first couple states that are giving into the people's demands. some states have not cooperated with people(texas, alaska). those are very few compared to the current states and future states that allow gay marriage. 7. the debate should be based on american law. agreed. 8. majority against same-sex marriage. if \"more than half of the population\" are against same-sex marriage(according to no resource or study), that is for a reason. the majority of people just don't like gay people. it takes time to show people what is right. rarely do you see a gay couple(without marriage) in any case. changes people's mind is not the correct reasoning. if the majority of the people decide to pass a law that states all blond haired people must pay tax then that is the law. if i in return do not like it, i can debate about it. if i fail to win the debate, due to people's strong support to my opponent, then there is nothing i can do about it after that. i can either live with it or move to another country that allows same taxation of blond and brown haired people. 9. bad side of gay marriage. in today's culture being gay and not married has more advantages then being gay and married to a person of the same sex. you will be discriminated and looked down upon. not because you are gay, but because you married gaily. here i will restate my resources' comment: \"but, did you know most civil, domestic and registered partnership laws around the world provide fewer benefits than full marriage? so in many cases, life-long partners are denied some or all of the rights of marriage simply based on their sexual orientation.\" therefore, getting married can have bad sides to it. the whole reason gay people get married is because of psychological satisfaction or because of legal benefits. yet some may not have same legal benefits as straight people can. this contradicts the reason to even get married in the first place. a.http://gaylife.about.com... conclusion: i have shown why same-sex marriage isn't marriage since the originally principals are not stated in the marriage. i have shown the types of marriages still do not allow same-sex marriage. i have restated my response that same-sex marriage is already being allowed and will be allowed soon enough, making this debate pointless. in our culture, people look more downly upon same-sex marriage then same-sex relationships and there are less benefits in same-sex marriage then straight people have. therefore, making same-sex marriage pointless as well as the debate. thank you.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "My opponent has not

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: ask almost anyone on the street and they will probably agree with you that homosexual's should have the same rights as heterosexuals. yet, once you get on the issue of marriage, more than half of the population in america is against it. this right to marriage is the last blockade for equal rights for homosexuals. i'll let my opponent go first.\n\nArgument 2: final argument: 1. marriage started by religion keeping the meaning of the origin should be done throughout everything. it keeps history correct. making another meaning for something can be wrong doing. a. take george orwell's \"animal farm\" novel for example. the pigs change the original meaning of the laws of the farm to benefit themselves. this also shows the other animals behave more obediently and overlook the meaning of something. i. http://en.wikipedia.org... 2. origination of marriage like i said in my first response, it is important to keep the meaning and history of something. although, this is a different debate and my opponent should not stray from the subject. 3. marriages. it seems i misunderstood my opponent's 2nd round response. he said \"[he] doubts [i'm] still an advocate of polygamy, endogamy, exogamy, proxy marriages.\" i took the types of marriage as his examples of types that allow same-sex marriage which he didn't intend to mean. therefore, i will go back to what my opponent said before. an adovate is someone who speaks on behalf of something or someone. in this case, on behalf of the types of marriages. so rewording this sentence, my opponent originally meant,\"i doubt my opponent is still speaking on behalf of [the different types of marriages].\" on my first response, i never said i will speak on behalf if the types of marriages. also, since my opponent himself said,\"i intend this debate to be based on american law\", it is obvious we should be debating base on the american way of marriage: 2 people of whatever breed/race in a society or out of one and not pre-arranged. 4. never did i say we should abandon it. \"the concept should not be deserted.\"-pawletoe(round 3, response #4). 5. everything matters in a creations of anything. for example, a singer writes his latest album and intends to sing it at an army camp to support the troops. except, another singer steals the lyrics and sings it at an urban night club that ends up booing the singer off the stage. as a result, the original singer is accused of stealing music. this is one reason why any thing's origin is important. this is why we have created copyright laws. putting your own definitions to something is great, as long as you change the word of that which you have changed. 6. gay marriage is already legalized. i argued with this because i am showing how the united states has already approved of same-sex marriage. i will extend on my point. massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004. 3 years later, so does new jersey. now on 2008, california(on may 15th) and new york(on may 29th). new york passed the law 14 days after california. this shows more and more states are giving into gay people's demands. i wouldn't be surprised if 2 or 3 more states agreed to same-sex marriage this year... 7. future states my point is more and more states are allowing same-sex marriage. which in turn, makes this debate pointless. if in 3 years, 40% more states allow same-sex marriage, it would be point argue about this since same-sex marriage will be getting the majority of approval. a. for example: if i challenged you to a debate and argued, \"president lincoln was shot in the head\". that would be a pointless debate since it is self-evident through history. 8. majority against same-sex marriage. let me clarify... while states are allowing same-sex marriage, we as people are against it. no we shouldn't debate about this since it will be legalized. yes you do have an opinion. 9. bad side of gay marriage the resource states that same-sex marriage(registered partnership) has less benefits then heterosexual marriages(full marriage). it clearly states gay couples have less of a benefit. 10. the argument is an example why not to get married. it shows that gay marriage has a bad effect instead of a good one. having a different benefit from gays and straights is unequal which contradicts the constitution of the united states. 11. finally, people don't adapt to gay couples because it is so different to them. it can actually be blamed on the gays themselves. gay people always \"hide in the closet\" and never show themselves for who they are. this makes the public believe everyone else believe gay is wrong. how do you eventually get the point across to the public that gay people want to marry as well? 12. gays can easily be compared to african americans. after slaves gained freedom and same rights, we as americans are forced to call them by their origin race: african americans. this should done with gay marriage as well. we should not allow gay couples to disrespect the religion of others by marrying with a priest and walking around a fire 7 times or breaking glass, and all the other traditions religions have, etc. this is a huge insult to those who are religious. conclusion: my opponent has to originally argue why marriage should be legalized. as the contender, i not only have to disprove my opponent, but can also point out an unsuccessful argument, pointless debate, the change of the subject's origin. 1. i stated the origin of marriage must stay true to it's origin. if not the history and meaning is lost and it becomes something else not marriage. 2. i showed that the debate and argument is pointless since the majority of states will legalize marriage. 3. i disproved my opponent by saying if we legalize same-sex marriage, gay married couple will naturally be treated different then straight married couple. this will bring much chaos. 4. i have pointed out gay marriage is useless and is only made to please the need of gay couples. on the other hand: gay people should not use the religious ways of getting married and should \"be registered as partners for life\". gay non-married couples can enjoy the better rights and benefits then having under same-sex marriage. gay couples can easily wait and fight for acceptance which should be the first step. gay people should concentrate on gaining respect from the public first. they should not hide who they are. i have disproved my opponent, have provided several different resources, and have argument against all his responses.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Same side.", "reference": "Not the same side"}

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGiven two arguments on a topic, decide whether they are on the same side or not.\n\n### Input:\nArgument 1: during the course of this debate my opponent has made wild assumptions, while ignoring the facts and the rule of law. he is arguing that gays do not have equal rights, yet he fails to point out a single legitimate right that heterosexuals have, but which is being refused to homosexuals. we all have the exact same rights, and the right to which i am referring is the right to marry someone of the opposite sex. there is no right to marry someone you love. furthermore, i have not abandoned my opening arguments; to the contrary, i am using this concluding round to bring my round one round two arguments full circle. while my opponent callously throws majority rule out the window, i cannot follow suit. the fact of the matter is that a clear majority of americans do not want gay marriage to be legalized (i offered an explanation of why in round one with the slippery slope argument). even more supportive of my position is that only 36% of americans actually support gay marriage (1). these statistical facts apparently hold no water with my opponent, which is strange because public support is the \"why\" and \"how\" most laws are created. in order for my opponent's premise that \"gay marriage should be legalized\" to become true, a law would have to be created and passed. it's a fact, there is currently no law recognizing gay marriage at the federal level. i can only assume my opponent is referring to a national law to recognize gay marriage since he did not specify a state for such a law. therefore, i merely pointed out the protocol by which to pass a federal law, and i am arguing that since no law has been passed, or even proposed, gay marriage should not be legalized. my opponent failed to reference any pending legislation at any level of government that would in fact legalize gay marriage, even though i asked for specific legislation in round one. if my opponent is unable to produce evidence of a pending bill in support of his argument, how can he possibly contend that gay marriage should be legalized? his arguments are merely based on his personal feelings and view of the world. furthermore, based on his anti-american comments for this debate, and his profile content, i suspect he doesn't really like traditional america (ie: democracy), and would instead prefer a socialistic-type of nation where the beliefs of a few rule the lives of many. in response to my opponent's bizarre suggestions that polygamy, bestiality, or incest should be made legal in order to support his argument that gay marriage should also be legalized, i would argue the exact same reasons to oppose such laws as i am here for gay marriage. in conclusion, gay marriage should not be legalized because: a) only 36% of americans support such a law, and 55% are opposed to it. b) there are no supporting bills in the pipeline. if there is no pending bill, then gay marriage shouldn't be legalized because it needs to first go through the proper channel to become a law. (1) http://pewforum.org...\n\nArgument 2: you are arguing that a law should be created to recognize gay marriage. let's consider what it takes to become a law at the federal level, and then we can clearly determine whether or not gay marriage should be legalized: according to http://www.usconstitution.net... here is the general process: \"first, a bill must pass both houses of congress by a majority vote. after it has passed out of congress, it is sent along to the president. if the president signs the bill, it becomes law. the president might not sign the bill, however. if he specifically rejects the bill, called a veto, the bill returns to congress. there it is voted on again, and if both houses of congress pass the bill again, but this time by a two-thirds majority, then the bill becomes law without the president's signature. this is called \"overriding a veto,\" and is difficult to do because of the two-thirds majority requirement. alternately, the president can sit on the bill, taking no action on it at all. if the president takes no action at all, and ten days passes (not including sundays), the bill becomes law without the president's signature. however, if the congress has adjourned before the ten days passes and without a presidential signature, the bill fails. this is known as a pocket veto.\" since the protocol as described above has not occurred in regards to legalized gay marriage, then it is indisputable that the recognition of gay marriage should not be a law. furthermore, in your comments of this debate you agreed with the statement, \"yeah, screw democracy.\" if you are not pro-democracy, then that would explain why you so easily threw aside my argument that a majority of americans do not want gay marriages to by recognized under the law. the fact of the matter is that we live in america, and it is a democracy (or representative democracy), and laws are created by a strict set of protocols which are directly influenced and affected by public opinion. homosexual americans have exactly the same rights as heterosexual americans, no less and no more. both groups of people are permitted to marry someone of the opposite sex.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "Same side.", "reference": "Same side"}
