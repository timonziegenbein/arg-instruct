However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.\n\n### Response:\n", "prediction": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInappropriate.", "reference": "Appropriate"}
